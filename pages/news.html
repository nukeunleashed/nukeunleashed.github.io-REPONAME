                           <br>
                            With the franchise's final instalment, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2, now premiered across the globe; Suzanne Collins took time to give thanks, and a final farewell, to this cinematic adaptation of her trilogy of YA novels in a letter featured on publisher Scholastic's website.

                            With the franchise's final instalment, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2, now premiered across the globe; Suzanne Collins took time to give thanks, and a final farewell, to this cinematic adaptation of her trilogy of YA novels in a letter featured on publisher Scholastic's website. 
                            <br><br>
                            Collins' letter is a simple yet elegant tribute from an author blessed with the opportunity to see her work come to such vivid life, as she praises the four-part franchise for being "both faithful to the books and innovative in their own right." 
                            <br><br>
                            Perhaps the most passionate outpouring of love is reserved for the series' star, Jennifer Lawrence. "There’s no Hunger Games without Katniss. I hoped for someone good enough, and I got someone who exceeded all my expectations. Jennifer Lawrence, your emotional depth, luminous presence, and sheer power carry this story and I will always be grateful to you for opening the door and allowing it to come into your life."
                            <br><br>
                            She ended the letter by thanking both readers and viewers for their support, and by expressing just part of what the trilogy represented personally. "For me, The Hunger Games Trilogy is part of a larger goal to introduce the ideas of just war theory to young audiences, but how much wider and more varied an audience came with the films, and the credit for that goes to all of you who contributed so much to this project." 
                            <br><br>
                            With the franchise so far grossing over $2.5 billion worldwide, Collins' letter reflects some of the phenomenal impact the series has had with younger fans, both on book and on screen. Never patronising or belittling, The Hunger Games will remain remarkable in its ambition to explore the matters of moral justification in war and strife, and in the difficult sacrifices we're forced to make in the fight for a better future. Questions that have agonised civilisations for centuries, yet here funnelled through the eyes of a teenage girl.
                            <br><br>
                            Collins admits, however, that "having spent the last decade in Panem, it's time to move on to other lands." Let's hope cinema moves with her.

                            Speaking at BookExpo America over the weekend, The Hunger Games trilogy author Suzanne Collins revealed she plans to return to the world of writing books for teens. 
                            <br><br>
                            Collins didn’t say more about her plans other than revealing her new book for teens will be a series.
                            <br><br>
                            Fans who fell in love with her for writing The Hunger Games were a tad disappointed when we learned in November that her next book Year of the Jungle is for children.
                            <br><br>
                            Collins told her audience at BEA that she’s currently helping with the scripts for Mockingjay – Part 1 and Mockingjay – Part 2, which will hit theaters in November 2014 and 2015 respectively.
                            <br><br>
                            Before The Hunger Games, Collins had written another series for teens that was lesser known titled The Underland Chronicles. Five books were published in the series between 2003 and 2007 before she moved on to her books following Katniss.
                            <br><br>
                            With Year of the Jungle being published this year (September 10), we can hope that the first book in her next teenage series could see the light of day by the end of 2014 or early 2015.
                            <br><br>
                            Can Collins strike gold twice? We’d love to see another huge series out of the author and are glad she’s returning to the genre that fans know her for most.
                            <br><br>
                            The Hunger Games: Catching Fire opens in theaters November 22.

                            Speaking at BookExpo America over the weekend, The Hunger Games trilogy author Suzanne Collins revealed she plans to return to the world of writing books for teens.
                            <br><br>
                            Collins didn’t say more about her plans other than revealing her new book for teens will be a series.
                            It's too early to know how durable this series will prove, but the signs so far are good. It has spent more than 100 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. The film has made converts of even the most curmudgeonly critics, grossing more than $531m (£327m) worldwide in its first four weeks. More than 1m copies of the books are now in print in the UK, and last month Amazon announced that Collins had become the bestselling Kindle author so far.
                            <br><br>
                            The woman behind the phenomenon is a bit of a mystery. Collins wrote for children's TV before turning to novels. She co-wrote the screenplay of The Hunger Games and is married to a TV actor – so knows a bit about the media circus – but she doesn't do publicity, hasn't even met her UK publishers, and seemed to tread the red carpet reluctantly at the film's Los Angeles premiere.
                            <br><br>
                            On her website, she is photographed in Central Park in New York, nose to snout with a toy rat, her long hair flowing witchily around her. "If you've read my fantasy series, The Underland Chronicles, you will have a clue as to why I chose this photo," she writes, offering no help to any visiting Hunger Games fan who had imagined her refulgent in a flaming robe.
                            <br><br>
                            Indeed, the whole site seems oddly out of synch. Her biography page and sole author interview are all about The Underland Chronicles, a five-part fantasy series starring an 11-year-old boy, which preceded The Hunger Games. Apart from a scattering of jacket picture and excitable press quotes, the only mention of the books that has made her name is: "Her next series, The Hunger Games trilogy, is an international bestseller."
                            <br><br>
                            Is her reluctance to self-publicise innocent or knowing? Either way, it's striking in the context of The Hunger Games, which is set in a nation, Panem, in which everything is televised. A fragmented post-apocalyptic society is ruled by the fascistic Capitol, which keeps the masses quiet by feeding them reality war games featuring teenagers who must fight to the last one standing.
                            <br><br>
                            The players who are "reaped" to play in the games are battling on two fronts: their primitive hand-to-hand combat, with whatever weapons come to hand, is mirrored by a more devious play for the sympathy – and sponsorship – of the people who are forced to watch. So the central character, Katniss, is both a warrior and a reality TV star with her own personal stylist. In these hunger games, it's not enough to be deadly with a bow and arrow; to survive, Katniss must seduce viewers into sending her food and medicine.
                            <br><br>
                            In a video interview made for her publisher, Scholastic, Collins says that the idea came to her when she was channel-surfing one night in bed. "I was very tired … and I was flipping though images on reality television where these young people were competing for a million dollars or whatever, then I was seeing footage from the Iraq war, and these two things began to fuse together in a very unsettling way, and that is the moment where I got the idea for Katniss's story.”
                            <br><br>
                            But the troubling relationship between war and the media was impressed on her long before that night. Her father spent his career in the US air force and served in Vietnam. "My mother tried really hard to protect us but occasionally after afternoon cartoons of whatever was on ... the nightly news would come on and I'd see footage from the war zone and I would hear the word Vietnam and I would know my dad was over there and it was a very frightening experience for me."
                            <br><br>
                            The globe-trotting life of an air force family inspired two other preoccupations that would become central to the trilogy – it gave her space to develop a fascination with classical mythology, and it took her to lots of battlefields, ancient and modern, which her historically minded father would explain to his four children in strategic detail. The idea of a vengeful state that sends young people to be slaughtered came from Theseus and the Minotaur, while the games themselves are modelled on the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome.
                            <br><br>
                            At the heart of the books is the character of Katniss – an action heroine, whose ambivalence about herself and others does not merely decorate the story but drives the plot.
                            <br><br>
                            It's a trick that is particularly admired by the novelist and screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, whose Alex Rider books have been one of the most successful action series in the UK over the past decade. He says: "Suzanne Collins has pulled off a remarkable coup, producing a female character that has equal appeal to both boys and girls and it's interesting how the book manages to balance an intricate and detailed love triangle with sequences of fairly gruesome violence. It's not often you find both these things between the covers of the same YA [young adult] book.
                            <br><br>
                            "It helps that Katniss Everdeen is extremely well-drawn; one of the reasons I liked the books so much. She's tough without being a tomboy and attractive without being a sophomore although she has elements of both. Her relationship with Peeta (is it love or expediency?) is particularly well-handled. Even she is unsure where her feelings truly lie.”
